# memories-MERN
A basic web app in MERN Stack# Isaac-Docker-Compose-PoC
This repo is a modified clone of Dheeraj Nagar, this is mainly a PoC demonstrating the Dockerizing of a MERN stack application.

I hereby take no credit in the creation of this application, I just simply written the appropriate Dockerfiles and a docker-compose file for it.
